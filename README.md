### Hey 👋🏽 I'm Leon — Welcome to My GitHub!

Just my little corner of the web, filled with code, bits and bobs that I've created in a weird multicolored text editor. I'm a software engineering techie hanging out in Phoenix, AZ. I'm always up for learning something new, solving problems, and generally geeking out.

- Check out my [portfolio site](https://www.leonredman.com/) to learn more about me, and my learnings on my journey to become a better developer.
- Graduated 4/2025 Bachelors of Science, Software Engineering.
